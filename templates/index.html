        <h1 style="text-align: center;">CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE ANALYSIS</h1>
        <div style="margin: 3em;">
            The term “chronic kidney disease” means lasting damage to the kidneys that can get worse over
            time. If the damage is very bad, your kidneys may stop working. This is called kidney failure,
            or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). If your kidneys fail, you will need dialysis or a kidney
            transplant in order to live.
            Anyone can get CKD. Some people are more at risk than others.
            Chronic kidney disease includes conditions that damage your kidneys and decrease their ability to keep you
            healthy by doing the jobs listed. If kidney disease gets worse, wastes can build to high levels in your
            blood and make you feel sick. You may develop complications like high blood pressure, anemia (low blood
            count), weak bones, poor nutritional health and nerve damage. Also, kidney disease increases your risk of
            having heart and blood vessel disease. These problems may happen slowly over a long period of time. Chronic
            kidney disease may be caused by diabetes, high blood pressure and other disorders. Early detection and
            treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. When kidney disease progresses, it may
            eventually lead to kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life.

                        <h3>Cause: </h3>
                        Some things that increase your risk for CKD include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diabetes</li>
                            <li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
                            <li>Heart disease</li>
                            <li>Having a family member with kidney disease</li>
                            <li>Being over 60 years old</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                        You may notice one or more of the following symptoms if your kidneys are beginning to fail:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Itching</li>
                            <li>Muscle cramps</li>
                            <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                            <li>Not feeling hungry</li>
                            <li>Swelling in your feet and ankles</li>
                            <li>Too much urine (pee) or not enough urine</li>
                            <li>Trouble catching your breath</li>
                            <li>Trouble sleeping</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Prevention</h3>
                        Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of CKD. If you have diabetes or high
                        blood pressure, working with your doctor to keep your blood sugar and blood pressure under
                        control is the best way to prevent kidney disease.

                        Living a healthy lifestyle can help prevent diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease, or
                        help keep them under control. Follow these tips to lower your risk for kidney disease and the
                        problems that cause it:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Follow a low-salt, low-fat diet</li>
                            <li>Exercise at least 30 minutes on most days of the week</li>
                            <li>Have regular check-ups with your doctor</li>
                            <li>Do not smoke or use tobacco</li>
                            <li>Limit alcohol</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        Damage to your kidneys is usually permanent. Although the damage cannot be fixed, you can take
                        steps to keep your kidneys as healthy as possible for as long as possible. You may even be able
                        to stop the damage from getting worse.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Control your blood sugar if you have diabetes.</li>
                            <li>Keep a healthy blood pressure.</li>
                            <li>Follow a low-salt, low-fat diet. </li>
                            <li>Exercise at least 30 minutes on most days of the week.</li>
                            <li>Keep a healthy weight.</li>
                            <li>Do not smoke or use tobacco.</li>
                            <li>Limit alcohol.</li>
                            <li>Talk to your doctor about medicines that can help protect your kidneys.</li>
                        </ul>

                        If you catch kidney disease early, you may be able to prevent kidney failure. If your kidneys
                        fail, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.
